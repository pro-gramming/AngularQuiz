# This file is for Pandey to understand what I have done in this repo.

1. First I created the Docker file 
2. Then I have created the docker ignore file which will tell which files and directories to not include.

3. Finally to you need to create the containers after creating the image 

4. But first for creating the docker image run below in directory where Dockerfile exists:
  > docker build -t angular:v1 . ( prepend sudo , if permission denied come across ) 

5. Now the images should have been created , to list the images :
  > docker image list   ||    > docker images 

6. Now to create the container with image run: 
  > docker run -d --name pandeybhosadika -p 8080:80 angular:v1 

7. Now the container should be up - now just access the application on your machine or VM Ip addr on port 8080 like: 
  > <Ip address>:8080

8. Good luck
